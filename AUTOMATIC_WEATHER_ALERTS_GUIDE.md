# Automatic Weather Alert System - Complete Guide

## 🤖 **Yes, It's Fully Automatic!**

The proactive weather alert system via Gmail is **completely automatic**. Here's exactly how it works:

## 🔄 **Automatic Process Flow**

### **1. Continuous Monitoring** 🌤️
- System automatically checks weather conditions for all properties
- Monitors current weather and 7-day forecasts
- Runs on a scheduled basis (hourly, daily, etc.)

### **2. Automatic Detection** 🚨
- System automatically detects severe weather conditions:
  - Heavy rainfall (>10mm)
  - Strong winds (>50 km/h)
  - Extreme temperatures (>38°C)
  - Thunderstorms
  - High humidity (>90%)

### **3. Automatic Email Sending** 📧
- **Landlords**: Automatically receive alerts for their properties
- **Tenants**: Automatically receive alerts for properties they're boarding at
- **Active Boarders Only**: Only tenants with 'active' status get alerts
- **Daily Limits**: Maximum 1 alert per property per day (prevents spam)

### **4. Automatic Scheduling** ⏰
- Runs automatically without manual intervention
- Configurable frequency (hourly, daily, every 6 hours, etc.)
- Background processing to avoid blocking other operations

## ⚙️ **How to Enable Automatic Operation**

### **Step 1: Schedule the Command**
The system is already set up to run automatically. In `app/Console/Kernel.php`:

```php
protected function schedule(Schedule $schedule): void
{
    // Run weather alerts every hour
    $schedule->command('weather:send-alerts')
             ->hourly()
             ->withoutOverlapping()
             ->runInBackground();
}
```

### **Step 2: Start the Scheduler**
Run this command on your server to enable automatic execution:

```bash
# For production servers (cron job)
* * * * * cd /path-to-your-project && php artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1

# For development/testing
php artisan schedule:work
```

### **Step 3: Verify Gmail Configuration**
Ensure your `.env` file has proper Gmail settings:

```env
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_USERNAME=your-email@gmail.com
MAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=your-email@gmail.com
MAIL_FROM_NAME="SmartStay Weather Alerts"
```
