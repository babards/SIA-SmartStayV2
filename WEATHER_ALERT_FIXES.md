# Weather Alert System - Fixes Applied

## 🐛 **Issues Fixed**

### 1. **Forecast Date Logic Error** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: The "upcoming weather" was showing today's date (Oct 18) instead of tomorrow onwards.

**Root Cause**: The forecast loop was starting from index 0, which included today's date.

**Solution**: Modified `formatForecastData()` method to start from index 1:
```php
// Before: for ($i = 0; $i < min(7, count($daily['time'])); $i++)
// After:  for ($i = 1; $i < min(7, count($daily['time'])); $i++)
```

**Result**: 
- ✅ Forecast now correctly shows tomorrow onwards (Sun 19, Mon 20, Tue 21, etc.)
- ✅ No more "Sat 18" in upcoming weather
- ✅ Forecast alerts now only trigger for actual upcoming days

### 2. **Email Template Buttons Removed** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Action buttons were present in both landlord and tenant emails.

**Solution**: Removed the entire button section from the email template:
```html
<!-- Removed this section -->
<div style="text-align: center; margin: 30px 0;">
    <a href="..." class="btn">View Property Details</a>
    <a href="..." class="btn">Manage Properties</a>
</div>
```

**Also Removed**: Associated CSS for buttons (`.btn` styles)

**Result**:
- ✅ Clean email template without action buttons
- ✅ Reduced email size and complexity
- ✅ Focus on essential weather information and recommendations
